# Born2beroot
This project aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of virtualization.

### What is Born2beroot?
Born2beroot is an individual project at [42](42sp.org.br) that requires us to create a virtual machine with [SSH server](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell), firewall rules and as a bonus an installation of [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) and a service like [FTP](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol) or [DNS](https://www.cloudflare.com/pt-br/learning/dns/what-is-a-dns-server/). The Operating System can be Debian or CentOS and a [monitoring script](monitoring.sh) with operating system information should run every 10 minutes.
